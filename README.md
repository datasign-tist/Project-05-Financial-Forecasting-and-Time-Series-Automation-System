# End-to-End Generative AI Driven Credit Risk Copilot

Combines classical credit risk analytics with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) layer to deliver explainable, source-cited underwriting decisions and automate the full model lifecycle on AWS.

---

## 1. Project Overview

The Credit Risk Copilot is a pioneering AI-powered assistant designed to revolutionize credit risk assessment workflows for financial institutions such as banks, fintech companies, and hedge funds.

### A. Purpose and Goals :

- Automate borrower credit assessments by integrating traditional credit risk models and cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Implement Basel III credit risk metrics–Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD)–alongside IFRS-9 expected credit loss staging for full regulatory compliance.
- Provide an interactive conversational AI assistant that explains risk decisions, answers underwriting policy queries, and cites authoritative documents.
- Enable real-time decision-making with explainability dashboards and governance controls, accelerating underwriting cycles from days to minutes.
- Deploy a robust, secure, and scalable MLOps pipeline on AWS, incorporating drift monitoring, experiment tracking, and seamless model lifecycle automation.

### B. Target Audience :

- Risk analysts and credit underwriters seeking explainable, faster decision support tools.
- Data scientists and ML engineers building compliant credit risk AI systems.
- DevOps teams implementing secure, scalable deployment pipelines in regulated environments.

### C. Success Metrics :

This project aims to achieve:

- Average credit decision turnaround time under 5 minutes.
- Predictive accuracy of classical scorecards with PD AUC ≥ 0.75.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) explanations with ≥ 90% source citation precision.
- Zero critical findings in security and compliance audits.

### D. Scope :

- Implementation of real-time data pipelines connecting loan origination and transaction systems.
- Development of hybrid credit scoring models and a generative AI layer for explainable recommendations.
- Full cloud deployment on AWS, including serverless APIs and batch retraining workflows.
- Explainability and regulatory reporting dashboards.
- The project excludes direct loan origination functionalities or external underwriting platforms integration.

## 2. Technical & Domain Knowledge Required :

This section highlights the technical knowledge, core risk theory, and practical tools you need to master for building the Credit Risk Copilot.

### 2.1 Technical & Theoretical Topics to Revise

- **Credit Risk Modeling:**
  - Probability of Default (PD) — scoring, calibration, and validation
  - Exposure at Default (EAD) — aggregation from transactional data
  - Loss Given Default (LGD) — recovery estimation methods
  - Expected Credit Loss (ECL) calculation
  - Classic scorecards vs. tree-ensemble models

- **Machine Learning Interpretability:**
  - SHAP values & interaction values
  - LIME for local explanations
  - Reason code generation in finance

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**
  - Architectures and workflows for combining LLMs and document retrieval
  - Embedding techniques and vector search principles

### 2.2 Tools, Frameworks, and Libraries to Learn

- **Data Engineering & Pipelines:**
  - Apache Kafka (streaming ETL)
  - PySpark (distributed processing)
  - Apache Airflow (workflow orchestration)
  - Advanced SQL and Snowflake (cloud data warehousing)

- **Modeling & AI:**
  - Python ML stack: sc
