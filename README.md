# End-to-End Generative AI Driven Credit Risk Copilot

Combines classical credit risk analytics with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) layer to deliver explainable, source-cited underwriting decisions and automate the full model lifecycle on AWS.

## 1. Project Overview

The Credit Risk Copilot is a pioneering AI-powered assistant designed to revolutionize credit risk assessment workflows for financial institutions such as banks, fintech companies, and hedge funds.

### A.Purpose and Goals :

- Automate borrower credit assessments by integrating traditional credit risk models and cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Implement Basel III credit risk metrics–Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD)–alongside IFRS-9 expected credit loss staging for full regulatory compliance.
- Provide an interactive conversational AI assistant that explains risk decisions, answers underwriting policy queries, and cites authoritative documents.
- Enable real-time decision-making with explainability dashboards and governance controls, accelerating underwriting cycles from days to minutes.
- Deploy a robust, secure, and scalable MLOps pipeline on AWS, incorporating drift monitoring, experiment tracking, and seamless model lifecycle automation.

### B.Target Audience :

- Risk analysts and credit underwriters seeking explainable, faster decision support tools.
- Data scientists and ML engineers building compliant credit risk AI systems.
- DevOps teams implementing secure, scalable deployment pipelines in regulated environments.

### C.Success Metrics :

This project aims to achieve:

- Average credit decision turnaround time under 5 minutes.
- Predictive accuracy of classical scorecards with PD AUC ≥ 0.75.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) explanations with ≥ 90% source citation precision.
- Zero critical findings in security and compliance audits.

### D.Scope :

- Implementation of real-time data pipelines connecting loan origination and transaction systems.
- Development of hybrid credit scoring models and a generative AI layer for explainable recommendations.
- Full cloud deployment on AWS, including serverless APIs and batch retraining workflows.
- Explainability and regulatory reporting dashboards.
- The project excludes direct loan origination functionalities or external underwriting platforms integration.
