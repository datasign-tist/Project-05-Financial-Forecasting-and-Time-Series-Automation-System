# End-to-End Generative AI Driven Credit Risk Copilot

Combines classical credit risk analytics with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) layer to deliver explainable, source-cited underwriting decisions and automate the full model lifecycle on AWS.

---

## 1. Project Overview

The Credit Risk Copilot is a pioneering AI-powered assistant designed to revolutionize credit risk assessment workflows for financial institutions such as banks, fintech companies, and hedge funds.

### A. Purpose and Goals :

- Automate borrower credit assessments by integrating traditional credit risk models and cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Implement Basel III credit risk metrics–Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD), and Loss Given Default (LGD)–alongside IFRS-9 expected credit loss staging for full regulatory compliance.
- Provide an interactive conversational AI assistant that explains risk decisions, answers underwriting policy queries, and cites authoritative documents.
- Enable real-time decision-making with explainability dashboards and governance controls, accelerating underwriting cycles from days to minutes.
- Deploy a robust, secure, and scalable MLOps pipeline on AWS, incorporating drift monitoring, experiment tracking, and seamless model lifecycle automation.

### B. Target Audience :

- Risk analysts and credit underwriters seeking explainable, faster decision support tools.
- Data scientists and ML engineers building compliant credit risk AI systems.
- DevOps teams implementing secure, scalable deployment pipelines in regulated environments.

### C. Success Metrics :

This project aims to achieve:

- Average credit decision turnaround time under 5 minutes.
- Predictive accuracy of classical scorecards with PD AUC ≥ 0.75.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) explanations with ≥ 90% source citation precision.
- Zero critical findings in security and compliance audits.

### D. Scope :

- Implementation of real-time data pipelines connecting loan origination and transaction systems.
- Development of hybrid credit scoring models and a generative AI layer for explainable recommendations.
- Full cloud deployment on AWS, including serverless APIs and batch retraining workflows.
- Explainability and regulatory reporting dashboards.
- The project excludes direct loan origination functionalities or external underwriting platforms integration.

## 2. Technical & Domain Knowledge Required :

This section outlines the essential domain knowledge, regulatory frameworks, business needs, and technical specifications that form the foundation of the Credit Risk Copilot.

### A. Credit Risk Fundamentals

- **Key Metrics:**
  - **Probability of Default (PD):** Likelihood of borrower default within a given timeframe.
  - **Exposure at Default (EAD):** Total value a bank is exposed to when a borrower defaults.
  - **Loss Given Default (LGD):** Proportion of the exposure that is lost after default.
  - **Expected Credit Loss (ECL):** Calculated as \( ECL = PD \times EAD \times LGD \), in line with IFRS 9 staging concepts.

- **Regulatory Frameworks:**
  - Basel III for capital adequacy and credit risk measurement.
  - IFRS 9 and CECL accounting standards for expected credit loss calculation.

### B. Regulatory Compliance

- Ensure all credit decisions provide a full audit trail, including model inputs, outputs, and versioning.
- Provide explainability through reason codes and SHAP/LIME values to satisfy regulatory requirements.
- Implement approval and governance workflows for model deployment and changes.
- Retain credit decision logs according to data privacy (GDPR, CCPA) and financial regulations.

### C. Business & Functional Requirements

- Target users: risk analysts, underwriters, compliance officers.
- Automate underwriting workflows to reduce decision time while maintaining accuracy.
- Support ingestion of both structured data (loan origination, transactions) and unstructured data (policy documents).
- Deliver interactive, explainable recommendations and justifications through the AI assistant.

### D. Technical Requirements

- Real-time and batch data pipelines using Kafka, Apache Spark, and Airflow.
- Scalable cloud infrastructure on AWS including Lambda, ECS, Snowflake, and secure networking (VPC).
- Security via encrypted data storage and transfer (AWS KMS), with fine-grained IAM access control.
- High availability and scalability to support thousands of daily credit decisions.

### E. Model & AI Layer Requirements

- Combine interpretable classical credit risk scorecards with advanced Generative AI explanations.
- Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector databases such as FAISS or Pinecone for document retrieval.
- Enable automated retraining, drift detection, and robust version control using MLflow.

### F. Explainability & Reporting

- Provide SHAP/LIME-based explainability visualizations and dashboards using Tableau or similar BI tools.
- Generate audit-ready reports documenting every underwriting decision.
- Log decisions, model inputs, and versions for full traceability.

### G. Non-Functional Requirements

- Maintain service reliability and system uptime with monitoring and alerting.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy laws and financial industry standards.
- Maintain clear documentation and coding standards to support continuous delivery and easy maintenance.

### H. Deliverables

- Documentation of credit risk domain, KPIs, and regulatory frameworks.
- Business rules and user requirements for automated underwriting.
- Detailed technical stack and infrastructure specification.
- Security and compliance guidelines.
- Performance targets and monitoring frameworks.
- Data governance and audit trail plans.
